==================
First clone the repository.

.. code-block:: python

   git clone https://github.com/liwz-lab/SpatialFuser.git
   cd SpatialFuser

It's recommended to create a separate conda environment for installing and running SpatialFuser:

.. code-block:: python

   #create an environment called env_SpatialFuser
   conda create -n env_SpatialFuser python=3.9.18

   #activate your environment
   conda activate env_SpatialFuser

Install all the required packages.

.. code-block:: python

   pip install -r requirements.txt

The torch-geometric library is also required, please see the installation steps in https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric#installation

The use of the mclust algorithm requires the rpy2 package (Python) and the mclust package (R). See https://pypi.org/project/rpy2/ and https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mclust/index.html for detail.
